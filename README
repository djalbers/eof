this directory conatins MATLAB code that calculates the EOF of a
multivariate time series, specifically, an EEG time series where the
dimensions correspond to frequencies. Relative to the example scripts
and data, we have frequencies ranging from 1 to 20 Hz with 0.5 Hz
resolution; lenght of the time series does not matter.

NOTE: this package relies on the MATLAB source "distinguishable colors."

GENERAL INFORMATION:

we have split this source into two categories:

all_eofs: this directory contains source that estimates and plots all the
eofs and their relative fractional variance for each eof.

output:
1. eof.X.jpg: the Xth EOF parameterized by time
2. fv_fig.jpg: the fractional variance for each EOF parameterized by
time 
3. fv_log_fig.jpg: the log of the fractional variance of each EOF
parameterized by time
4. eof_seizure_whole.data: a data file containing the variable number
where the first eof has its maximum per time

first_eof_only: this directory contains source that estimates all eofs but
only plots the first as well as the fractional variance.

output:
1. eof_whole_fig.jpg: a plot of the first eof and the fractional variance
of the first eof in time.
2. eof_only_whole_fig.jpg: a plot of the first eof in time
3. eof_seizure_whole.data: a data file containing the variable number
where the first eof has its maximum per time

NOTE: both calculations have demo scripts, but currently all of the source
requires parameters to be changed by the user if the data are not in the
format given below and if the user wants a different eof
resolution. note that the eof resolution must always all for the
number of time points to be at least as large as the number of
variables to avoid matrix rank problems.

DATA FILE FORMAT:

the data are represented as a matrix, are located in ./data and contained in
a file titled "foo.data" as per the demo.

the assumed time resolution is in minutes

rows = time
columns = variables
